# XYZ Hierarchy Network — User Guide

This app is a generic hierarchy/network product. It is **not limited to a family surname**. It can represent a family, lineage, community, association or any multi-generation relationship network.

## 1. What you see first
The demo dataset contains **150 synthetic members across 6 generations**. It intentionally includes siblings, spouses, branches, multiple cities and deceased members so the features can be tested without real personal data.

## 2. Family Hierarchy
- **Family Hierarchy** opens the visual relationship graph.
- Solid connectors = parent/child lineage.
- Dashed connectors = spouse relationship.
- Use mouse wheel / trackpad to zoom and drag the canvas to pan.
- `+ / -` controls change zoom; the mini-map helps navigate larger trees.
- Click any person to open their profile.
- Search dims non-matching people.

### Lineage Focus
1. Click a member.
2. Choose **View in Family Tree** or **Focus Lineage**.
3. The app isolates the connected branch: parents, children, siblings and spouses that are reachable through recorded relationships.
4. **Show Full Tree** returns to the entire network.

This is intentionally a network view rather than a simple top-down org chart because real families contain marriages and sibling branches.

## 3. Member Directory
Search and filter by:
- Name
- Profession
- City/location

Use **View Profile** for details or **Focus Lineage** to jump back to the relationship graph.

## 4. Member Profile
A profile can show:
- Name and generation
- Profession
- City/country
- Date of birth
- About/bio
- Phone and email depending on visibility mode
- Recorded family connections

Click a connected person to navigate directly to their profile.

## 5. Privacy Preview
The top-right selector is a **preview of the intended privacy model**:
- **Public**: phone/email are hidden.
- **Member**: contact details can be shown to authenticated members.
- **Admin**: intended for administrators.

Important: the current local demo is client-side. Real production privacy must be enforced in Supabase RLS/API, not only by hiding fields in the UI.

## 6. Location Map
Open **Location Map** from the left navigation.

Each member with latitude/longitude appears on the map. In the sample data, city coordinates are provided for Pune, Mumbai, Jalgaon, Nashik, Bengaluru, Delhi, London and Dubai.

Click a marker to see the member name, profession and city, then use **View profile**.

The map is useful for questions such as:
- How many members are in Pune?
- Who lives outside India?
- Where are community clusters?

The map is not a precise home-address map. For privacy, production should normally store city/region coordinates rather than residential addresses.

## 7. In-Memoriam
A member is treated as deceased when `date_of_death` is present.

In the hierarchy their node is visually subdued/grayscale and shows the death year. Their profile retains the recorded birth/death information.

This is a **presentation feature**, not a separate person type. A deceased person can still be an ancestor, spouse or parent in the same relationship network.

The sample includes several deceased members specifically to make this visible during testing.

## 8. Submit Profile
A member can submit a profile without directly editing the master record. The submission enters the pending queue.

The intended production workflow is:
`Member submits → Admin reviews → Approve/Reject → Master profile updated`

## 9. Administration
Administration currently provides:
- Member count
- Relationship count
- Pending profile count
- Location count
- CSV/XLSX import
- CSV export
- JSON export
- Demo reset
- Pending submission approval/rejection

## 10. Bulk Import
Supported input: CSV/XLSX first sheet.

Useful columns:
`id, full_name, generation_level, profession, city, country, latitude, longitude, date_of_birth, date_of_death, father, mother, spouse, photo_url, bio, phone, email`

For relationship import, `father`, `mother` and `spouse` are resolved against `full_name`. Production should eventually prefer stable member IDs because names can duplicate.

## 11. Export / Backup
- **CSV** exports member/profile data.
- **JSON** exports both members and relationships and is the better structural backup.

## 12. Sample hierarchy
The included 150-member dataset is intentionally synthetic and contains:
- 6 generations
- 150 people
- parent/child relationships
- sibling branches created by shared parents
- spouse relationships
- a few cross-branch marriages
- deceased ancestors
- multiple Indian and international locations
- varied professions

Use this dataset to test the app before importing real family data.

## 13. Recommended next production features
Before adding AI/analytics/PDF features, prioritize:
1. Stable relationship editor (add/edit/remove parent, child, spouse, sibling).
2. Duplicate detection and merge.
3. Relationship validation and orphan detection.
4. Authenticated member/admin roles with real RLS.
5. Approval workflow for profile and relationship changes.
6. Audit history.
7. Better large-tree layout/performance.
8. City-level map clustering.
